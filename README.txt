Dead simple static gallery generator using PhotoSwipe
=====================================================

About
-----
PhotoSwipe doesn't come out of the box with a turnkey solution for generating static photo galleries.

I wrote a small bash script to do this since PhotoSwipe is the only free solution I found which works nicely on both smartphones and desktop computers.

License
-------
I impose no further restrictions than PhotoSwipe itself which is under BSD, see license.txt for details.
